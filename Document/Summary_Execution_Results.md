| **C1** | **LeNet-5 - Parallel Version 1 (Im2Col) - Same as (C0), but get unrolled image results directly from dynamic memory to Matrix object** | **$ \approx 539.801 $** | **0.8297** | **41349.5** |
| **D0** | **LeNet-5 - Parallel Version 2 (MatMul) - Save matrix while multiplying as column-major order** | | **0.8297** | **31260.9** |

[^1]: Avarage of all forward passes in first epoch.
[^2]: The Test set contains 10000 samples. The results is the best one after re-run the executable files 10 times.
